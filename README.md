----------------------------- Pokémon GO Webstore Enhancement -----------------------------
Description:
This is a final project for IT0063 Advanced Web Design, where we developed an enhanced version of the Pokémon GO Webstore. The project includes multiple pages: home, registration, store, cart, payment, transaction history, and profile. It also features a user-friendly registration form that auto-generates a unique Player ID. The project makes use of official Pokémon GO images with proper attribution and is for educational purposes only. No database integration is required.

Features:
  Home Page: The main landing page for the webstore.
  Registration Page: Users can sign up with email, password, and in-game name. The Player ID is auto-generated.
  Store Page: A showcase of in-game items.
  Cart Page: Displays selected items and pricing details.
  Payment Page: Used to confirm payment methods.
  Transaction History Page: Displays past transactions.
  Profile Page: Displays the user's personal information.

Installation:
  Clone this repository.
  Open index.html in your browser to start exploring the webstore.
